# Railway Database Cleanup Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to clean the Railway production database, removing all data except the admin user (`jorge.gangale@mtn.cl`).

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** This is a DESTRUCTIVE operation. All data will be permanently deleted except the admin user.

## What Will Be Deleted

The cleanup script removes data in this order (respecting foreign key constraints):

1. **Documents** - All file uploads
2. **Evaluations** - All evaluations (except those assigned to admin)
3. **Interviews** - All interview records (except admin's interviews)
4. **Interviewer Schedules** - All schedules (except admin's)
5. **Notifications** - All notifications (except admin's)
6. **Applications** - All applications (except those created by admin)
7. **Students** - All students (except those in admin's applications)
8. **Guardians** - All guardians (except guardian record for admin)
9. **Users** - All users except admin

## What Will Be Preserved

- **Admin User:** jorge.gangale@mtn.cl (ID will vary)
  - Email: jorge.gangale@mtn.cl
  - Role: ADMIN
  - Password: Existing BCrypt hash (unchanged)

## Scripts Included

### 1. Main Cleanup Script (`scripts/cleanup-railway-db.js`)

Node.js script that connects to Railway PostgreSQL and performs the cleanup.

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Uses database transactions (ROLLBACK on error)
- ‚úÖ Dry-run mode for testing
- ‚úÖ Detailed progress logging
- ‚úÖ Pre/post verification
- ‚úÖ FK constraint-aware deletion order

**Usage:**
```bash
# Dry-run mode (safe, no changes)
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:xxxxx@postgres.railway.internal:5432/railway"
node scripts/cleanup-railway-db.js --dry-run

# Execute mode (DESTRUCTIVE)
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:xxxxx@postgres.railway.internal:5432/railway"
node scripts/cleanup-railway-db.js --execute
```

### 2. Wrapper Script (`scripts/cleanup-railway-wrapper.sh`)

Bash wrapper with safety confirmations and instructions.

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Checks for DATABASE_URL environment variable
- ‚úÖ Validates command line arguments
- ‚úÖ Requires explicit confirmation for execute mode
- ‚úÖ Provides step-by-step instructions

**Usage:**
```bash
# Set DATABASE_URL first
export DATABASE_URL="<get_from_railway_dashboard>"

# Run with wrapper
./scripts/cleanup-railway-wrapper.sh --dry-run
./scripts/cleanup-railway-wrapper.sh --execute
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Get Railway DATABASE_URL

1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Select project: **Admision_MTN_Backend**
3. Click on **PostgreSQL** service (database icon)
4. Go to **Connect** tab
5. Copy **Postgres Connection URL**

The URL will look like:
```
postgresql://postgres:xxxxx@postgres.railway.internal:5432/railway
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable

In your terminal:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:xxxxx@postgres.railway.internal:5432/railway"
```

**IMPORTANT:** Replace `xxxxx` with the actual password from Railway.

### Step 3: Test with Dry-Run

**ALWAYS run dry-run first** to see what would be deleted:

```bash
cd Admision_MTN_backend
node scripts/cleanup-railway-db.js --dry-run
```

**Expected output:**
```
========================================
üóëÔ∏è  RAILWAY DATABASE CLEANUP
========================================
Mode: üîç DRY RUN (no changes)

üîç Step 1: Finding admin user...
   Found 1 admin user(s):
   - ID 1: jorge.gangale@mtn.cl (Jorge Gangale)

‚úÖ Will preserve admin user: jorge.gangale@mtn.cl (ID 1)

üìä Step 2: Current data counts...
   users                    : 87 rows
   guardians                : 25 rows
   students                 : 42 rows
   applications             : 38 rows
   evaluations              : 56 rows
   interviews               : 31 rows
   interviewer_schedules    : 12 rows
   documents                : 19 rows
   notifications            : 45 rows

üóëÔ∏è  Step 3: Executing cleanup...

   ‚úÖ documents                : 19 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ evaluations              : 56 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ interviews               : 31 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ interviewer_schedules    : 12 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ notifications            : 45 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ applications             : 38 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ students                 : 42 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ guardians                : 25 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ users                    : 86 rows deleted

üîç DRY RUN: Rolling back transaction (no changes made)

‚úÖ Step 4: Verification...

   Users remaining: 87 (should be 1)  # Still 87 because of ROLLBACK
   ‚úÖ Admin user preserved: jorge.gangale@mtn.cl
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  documents                : 19 rows (not empty)
   [... all tables still populated because of ROLLBACK ...]

========================================
‚úÖ DRY RUN COMPLETE
========================================

No changes were made to the database.
Review the output above to see what would be deleted.

To execute the cleanup for real, run:
  node scripts/cleanup-railway-db.js --execute
```

### Step 4: Execute Cleanup (if dry-run looks correct)

**ONLY proceed if dry-run output looks correct.**

```bash
node scripts/cleanup-railway-db.js --execute
```

**Expected output:**
```
========================================
üóëÔ∏è  RAILWAY DATABASE CLEANUP
========================================
Mode: ‚ö†Ô∏è  EXECUTE (DESTRUCTIVE)

[... same as dry-run until cleanup step ...]

üóëÔ∏è  Step 3: Executing cleanup...

   ‚úÖ documents                : 19 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ evaluations              : 56 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ interviews               : 31 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ interviewer_schedules    : 12 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ notifications            : 45 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ applications             : 38 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ students                 : 42 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ guardians                : 25 rows deleted
   ‚úÖ users                    : 86 rows deleted

‚ö†Ô∏è  EXECUTE: Committing transaction (changes permanent)

‚úÖ Step 4: Verification...

   Users remaining: 1 (should be 1)
   ‚úÖ Admin user preserved: jorge.gangale@mtn.cl
   ‚úÖ documents                : 0 rows (clean)
   ‚úÖ evaluations              : 0 rows (clean)
   ‚úÖ interviews               : 0 rows (clean)
   ‚úÖ interviewer_schedules    : 0 rows (clean)
   ‚úÖ notifications            : 0 rows (clean)
   ‚úÖ applications             : 0 rows (clean)
   ‚úÖ students                 : 0 rows (clean)
   ‚úÖ guardians                : 0 rows (clean)

========================================
‚úÖ CLEANUP COMPLETE
========================================

‚ö†Ô∏è  All data has been deleted except the admin user.
   Database is now in a clean state.
```

### Step 5: Verify Railway Deployment

After cleanup, verify the system still works:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://admisionmtnbackendv2-production.up.railway.app/health

# Test admin login
curl -X POST https://admisionmtnbackendv2-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"jorge.gangale@mtn.cl","password":"admin123"}'

# Expected: 200 OK with JWT token
```

## Alternative: Using Wrapper Script

For extra safety, use the wrapper script:

```bash
# Set DATABASE_URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:xxxxx@postgres.railway.internal:5432/railway"

# Test with dry-run
./scripts/cleanup-railway-wrapper.sh --dry-run

# Execute (requires typing "DELETE EVERYTHING" to confirm)
./scripts/cleanup-railway-wrapper.sh --execute
```

The wrapper script will:
1. Check that DATABASE_URL is set
2. Validate the mode (--dry-run or --execute)
3. For execute mode, require typing "DELETE EVERYTHING" to confirm
4. Run the Node.js cleanup script

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "DATABASE_URL environment variable not found"

**Solution:** Set the DATABASE_URL:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:xxxxx@postgres.railway.internal:5432/railway"
```

### Error: "No admin user found"

**Solution:** The script expects an admin user with email `jorge.gangale@mtn.cl`. If this user doesn't exist, modify the script at line 55 to use a different admin email.

### Error: "Foreign key constraint violation"

**Solution:** The script deletes in the correct order to avoid FK violations. If this error occurs, it indicates a missing table in the deletion sequence. Contact the development team.

### Error: "Connection timeout"

**Solution:** Railway internal network might be inaccessible from outside. This script must be run:
- From Railway CLI: `railway run node scripts/cleanup-railway-db.js --dry-run`
- OR by setting up proper network access to `postgres.railway.internal`

## Safety Features

### 1. Dry-Run Mode
- **Always runs in transaction with ROLLBACK**
- Shows exactly what would be deleted
- No actual changes made to database

### 2. Transaction Safety
- All deletions wrapped in BEGIN/COMMIT transaction
- ROLLBACK on any error
- Atomic operation (all-or-nothing)

### 3. Admin User Protection
- Script FAILS if admin user not found
- Admin user ID hardcoded in all delete queries
- Impossible to accidentally delete admin

### 4. Verification Step
- Counts remaining rows after cleanup
- Verifies admin user still exists
- Checks all tables are empty (execute mode)

### 5. Confirmation Required
- Wrapper script requires typing "DELETE EVERYTHING"
- No accidental executions possible

## Recovery

**There is NO recovery from this operation.** All deleted data is permanently lost.

**Backup strategy (if needed):**

Before running cleanup, create a full database dump:

```bash
# From Railway dashboard, get DATABASE_URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:xxxxx@postgres.railway.internal:5432/railway"

# Create backup
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" > railway_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Compress backup
gzip railway_backup_*.sql
```

**Restore from backup (if needed):**

```bash
# Decompress
gunzip railway_backup_20250101_120000.sql.gz

# Restore
psql "$DATABASE_URL" < railway_backup_20250101_120000.sql
```

## Technical Details

### Database Tables Processed

1. **documents** (FK to applications)
2. **evaluations** (FK to applications, users)
3. **interviews** (FK to applications, users)
4. **interviewer_schedules** (FK to users)
5. **notifications** (FK to users)
6. **applications** (FK to students, guardians, users)
7. **students** (FK to guardians)
8. **guardians** (FK to users)
9. **users** (parent table)

### Deletion Logic

Each table uses this pattern:
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition_excluding_admin
```

Examples:
```sql
-- Delete all users except admin
DELETE FROM users WHERE id != $1  -- $1 = admin user ID

-- Delete all applications not created by admin
DELETE FROM applications WHERE created_by != $1

-- Delete all evaluations not assigned to admin
DELETE FROM evaluations WHERE assigned_to_user_id != $1
```

### Connection Configuration

```javascript
const dbPool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: false,  // Railway internal network
  max: 1       // Single connection for safety
});
```
