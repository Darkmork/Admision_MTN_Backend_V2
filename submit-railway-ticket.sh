Subject: CRITICAL - POST requests with JSON payload timing out (0% success rate)

All POST requests with Content-Type: application/json and a request body are timing out after 10-30 seconds with 0 bytes received. GET requests work perfectly.

IMPACT:
- Users cannot log in (POST /api/auth/login)
- Users cannot submit applications (POST /api/applications)
- Production system is 100% unusable for write operations
- Success rate: 0% for all POST requests with JSON

PATTERN IDENTIFIED:
‚úÖ GET /health ‚Üí 200 OK in 0.640s (WORKS)
‚úÖ GET /api/auth/public-key ‚Üí 200 OK in 0.623s (WORKS)
‚úÖ POST /api/security/csrf-token (no body) ‚Üí 404 in 0.598s (WORKS)
‚ùå POST /api/auth/login (with JSON) ‚Üí TIMEOUT 30s, 0 bytes (FAILS)
‚ùå POST /api/applications/search (with JSON) ‚Üí TIMEOUT 10s, 0 bytes (FAILS)

EVIDENCE:
- 0 bytes received = Response never arrives
- No backend logs = Requests never reach service
- Works locally in 77ms = Code is correct
- Railway blocking at infrastructure layer (WAF/Firewall/Proxy)

REPRODUCTION:
curl -X POST "https://admisionmtnbackendv2-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"jorge.gangale@mtn.cl","password":"admin123"}' \
  --max-time 30

Result: Timeout after 30s with 0 bytes received

QUESTIONS:
1. Are POST requests with JSON bodies being blocked by WAF/firewall?
2. Can you provide Railway-side logs showing what happens to these requests?
3. Is there rate limiting causing this?
4. Is this a known proxy layer issue?
5. Can you whitelist our project if this is a security rule?

URGENCY: CRITICAL - Production completely down
