## How to Use Agents

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// In Claude Code CLI
user: "I need to fix CORS errors between frontend and backend"
assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the gateway-architect agent..."
```

### Parallel Agent Execution

For complex features requiring multiple domains:

```typescript
user: "Implement complete payment feature"
assistant: "I'll launch multiple agents in parallel:
1. backlog-story-architect - Analyze payment user story gaps
2. fe-be-contract-auditor - Verify form fields match backend DTO
3. application-documents-service - Integrate payment with applications
4. notification-service-builder - Send payment confirmation emails
5. gateway-architect - Add payment routes to NGINX
6. cicd-architect - Add payment tests to CI pipeline"
```

### Proactive Agent Selection

Agents are automatically selected based on task context:
- **CORS issues** ‚Üí gateway-architect
- **Auth problems** ‚Üí user-auth-service-builder
- **CI/CD failures** ‚Üí cicd-architect or lockfile-ci-fixer
- **Form validation** ‚Üí frontend-spa-specialist
- **Contract mismatches** ‚Üí fe-be-contract-auditor
- **Bugs** ‚Üí bug-tracer-fixer

## Best Practices

### 1. **Single Responsibility**
Use the most specific agent for the task. Don't use cicd-architect for frontend tasks.

### 2. **Agent Chaining**
For complex features, use agents sequentially:
1. backlog-story-architect (plan)
2. fe-be-contract-auditor (verify contracts)
3. Specific implementation agents
4. bug-tracer-fixer (if issues arise)
5. cicd-architect (add tests to pipeline)

### 3. **Context Provision**
Always provide:
- Current branch name
- Relevant file paths
- Error messages or logs
- Desired outcome

### 4. **Validation**
After agent work:
- Review generated code
- Test locally
- Check documentation
- Verify confidence level
