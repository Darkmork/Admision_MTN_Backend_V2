## ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES**

### Issue #1: Login Endpoint Timeout
**Severity:** HIGH
**Description:** `/api/auth/login` endpoint times out after ~10 seconds

**Evidence:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://admisionmtnbackendv2-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"jorge.gangale@mtn.cl","password":"admin123"}'

# Result: Timeout after 10s
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. ✅ Database has data (confirmed with direct psql queries)
2. ✅ User `jorge.gangale@mtn.cl` exists with ID 25
3. ✅ Service is running (health check passes)
4. ❌ Login query times out (likely BCrypt or DB query issue)

**Possible Causes:**
- BCrypt password hashing taking too long in Railway environment
- Database query optimization needed
- Connection pooling not working correctly after restart
- Network latency between service and database

**Workaround:**
- Increase timeout in frontend API calls
- Add health check endpoint that doesn't require BCrypt
- Consider using simpler authentication for testing

**Action Items:**
1. [ ] Check Railway logs for SQL query times
2. [ ] Test with a simpler endpoint (GET /api/users/roles works fine)
3. [ ] Consider adding query logging to identify slow query
4. [ ] Test BCrypt performance in Railway environment

## 📊 **DEPLOYMENT METRICS**

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Backend Services | 6/6 | ✅ Running |
| Database Records | 144 | ✅ Restored |
| Health Check | <100ms | ✅ Passing |
| Gateway Proxy | Working | ✅ OK |
| Environment Config | Complete | ✅ OK |
| Login Endpoint | Timeout | ⚠️ Issue |

**Overall Deployment Score:** 85/100

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

### Immediate (Required)
1. **Debug Login Timeout**
   - Check Railway service logs
   - Add query performance logging
   - Test BCrypt alternatives if needed

2. **Configure Frontend**
   - Update Vercel environment variable
   - Point to Railway backend URL
   - Test with health endpoints first

### Short Term (Recommended)
3. **Add Monitoring**
   - Set up UptimeRobot for health check
   - Configure Railway alerts
   - Add performance monitoring

4. **Run Smoke Tests**
   - Once login works, run full test suite
   - Validate all 47 tests pass
   - Document any additional issues

### Long Term (Optional)
5. **Optimize Performance**
   - Review BCrypt rounds configuration
   - Add database query caching
   - Implement rate limiting

6. **Add Custom Domain**
   - Configure `api.mtn.cl` → Railway
   - Set up SSL/TLS
   - Update CORS configuration

## 📝 **CONFIGURATION REFERENCE**

### Railway URLs
- **Backend:** https://admisionmtnbackendv2-production.up.railway.app
- **Health:** https://admisionmtnbackendv2-production.up.railway.app/health
- **PostgreSQL:** (Internal only - use public endpoint for external access)

### Vercel Frontend Configuration
```bash
# Environment Variable to set in Vercel:
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://admisionmtnbackendv2-production.up.railway.app
```

### Test Credentials
- **Admin:** jorge.gangale@mtn.cl / admin123 (ID: 25)
- **Teacher (Math):** alejandra.flores@mtn.cl / profe123
- **Teacher (Language):** patricia.silva@mtn.cl / profe123

### Database Connection (Public)
```
# Get from Railway Dashboard → Postgres → Connect → Public Networking
postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@HOST.proxy.rlwy.net:PORT/railway
```

---

## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### If Login Still Times Out
```bash
# 1. Check service logs in Railway Dashboard
# Look for SQL queries or BCrypt errors

# 2. Test database connectivity directly
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"

# 3. Test a simpler endpoint
curl https://admisionmtnbackendv2-production.up.railway.app/api/users/roles

# 4. Restart service again
# Railway Dashboard → Service → ... → Restart
```

### If Services Won't Start
```bash
# Check Railway logs for:
- Database connection errors
- Missing environment variables
- Port binding issues
- Memory/CPU limits
```
