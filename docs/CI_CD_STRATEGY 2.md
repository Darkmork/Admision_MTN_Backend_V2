## CI Pipeline (Continuous Integration)

### Build Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`
- Pull requests to `main`, `develop`
- Scheduled runs (daily security scans)

**Stages:**
1. **Code Quality**
   - Linting (ESLint, Checkstyle)
   - Code formatting validation
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests with coverage (minimum 80%)
   - Integration tests
   - Contract testing (Pact)
   - Performance baseline tests

3. **Security Analysis**
   - SAST with SonarQube
   - Dependency scanning with OWASP
   - Secret detection with TruffleHog
   - License compliance check

4. **Build Artifacts**
   - Compile application (Maven/Gradle)
   - Generate test reports
   - Create deployment manifests

**Quality Gates:**
- Test coverage ≥ 80%
- Security vulnerability score ≥ A
- Performance regression < 5%
- All tests must pass

### Container Image Pipeline (`image.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Successful CI pipeline completion
- Manual trigger for hotfixes
- Scheduled rebuilds for base image updates

**Process:**

   COPY . /app
   WORKDIR /app
   RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests
   
   # Runtime stage
   FROM gcr.io/distroless/java17-debian11:nonroot
   COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar /app.jar
   EXPOSE 8080
   ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
   ```

2. **Multi-platform Build**
   - linux/amd64 (primary)
   - linux/arm64 (Apple Silicon support)

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Distroless base images
   - Non-root user execution
   - Minimal attack surface
   - Read-only filesystem

4. **Image Analysis**

   - Size optimization verification

5. **SBOM Generation**
   - Syft for comprehensive SBOM
   - CycloneDX format compatibility
   - Dependency graph analysis
   - License information extraction

6. **Image Signing**
   - Cosign with OIDC keyless signing
   - GitHub OIDC identity verification
   - Transparency log integration
   - Supply chain attestation

## CD Pipeline (Continuous Deployment)

### Deployment Pipeline (`deploy.yml`)

**Environment Progression:**
```
Development → Staging → Production
     ↓           ↓          ↓
   Auto        Auto    Manual Gate
```

**Deployment Stages:**

#### 1. Development Deployment
- **Trigger:** Successful image build
- **Strategy:** Rolling deployment (immediate)
- **Validation:** Health checks, smoke tests
- **Rollback:** Automatic on failure

#### 2. Staging Deployment  
- **Trigger:** Dev deployment success
- **Strategy:** Blue-green deployment
- **Validation:** Full test suite, performance tests
- **Duration:** Soak testing for 30 minutes
- **Rollback:** Automatic on quality gate failure

#### 3. Production Deployment
- **Trigger:** Manual approval after staging validation
- **Strategy:** Canary deployment with Argo Rollouts
- **Validation:** Real-time metrics analysis
- **Rollback:** Automatic on metric thresholds

### Canary Deployment Strategy

#### Phase 1: Initial Canary (5%)
```yaml
steps:
  - setWeight: 5
  - pause: { duration: 5m }
  - analysis:
      templates:
        - templateName: success-rate
        - templateName: latency-p99
      successCondition: result[0] >= 0.99
      failureLimit: 1
```

**Metrics Monitored:**
- Success rate ≥ 99%
- P99 latency ≤ 500ms
- Error rate ≤ 0.01%
- CPU usage ≤ 80%
- Memory usage ≤ 90%

#### Phase 2: Gradual Rollout
- **10%** → Wait 10min → Analyze
- **25%** → Wait 15min → Analyze  
- **50%** → Wait 20min → Analyze
- **100%** → Complete deployment

**Analysis Templates:**
```yaml
# Success Rate Analysis
successCondition: |
  (sum(rate(http_requests_total{status!~"5.."}[2m])) /
   sum(rate(http_requests_total[2m]))) >= 0.99

# Latency Analysis  
successCondition: |
  histogram_quantile(0.99,
    sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[2m])) by (le)
  ) <= 0.5
```

### Feature Flags Integration

**Traffic Routing Control:**
```yaml
feature_flags:
  user_service_routing:
    enabled: true
    rollout_percentage: 100
    canary_percentage: 0
    targeting:
      user_roles: ["ADMIN", "TEACHER"]
      beta_users: true
```

**Dynamic Routing:**
- Real-time traffic split adjustment
- User-based targeting (role, beta status)
- Geographic routing capability
- A/B testing integration

## Rollback Strategies

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

1. **Metric-based Rollback**
   - Success rate drops below 99%
   - P99 latency exceeds 1000ms
   - Error rate exceeds 1%
   - CPU usage exceeds 95%

2. **Health Check Failures**
   - Readiness probe failures > 3
   - Liveness probe failures > 3
   - External dependency failures

3. **Business Logic Failures**
   - Critical API endpoint failures
   - Database connection issues
   - Message queue problems

### Manual Rollback Procedures

#### 1. Emergency Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# Using Argo Rollouts
kubectl argo rollouts abort user-service -n production
kubectl argo rollouts undo user-service -n production

# Using Feature Flags (Immediate)
curl -X PATCH http://feature-flag-service:8080/api/flags/user_service_routing \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"canary_percentage": 0, "rollout_percentage": 0}'
```

#### 2. Standard Rollback (< 10 minutes)
```bash
# Helm-based rollback
helm rollback user-service -n production

# Verify rollback
kubectl get pods -n production -l app=user-service
kubectl logs -f deployment/user-service -n production
```

#### 3. Complete Infrastructure Rollback
```bash
# Multi-service coordinated rollback
./scripts/emergency-rollback.sh --services=user,application,evaluation
```

### Rollback Validation

**Post-Rollback Checks:**
1. Health endpoint responses (< 30s)
2. Database connectivity tests
3. Message queue connectivity
4. External API integration tests  
5. End-to-end smoke tests

**Monitoring During Rollback:**
- Error rate normalization
- Response time improvement
- Resource utilization stabilization
- User experience metrics

   - Infrastructure as code state

### Recovery Procedures

**RTO/RPO Targets:**
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 30 minutes
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective): 1 hour

**Recovery Scenarios:**
1. Single service failure → Automatic failover
2. Database failure → Switch to replica
3. Cluster failure → Multi-region deployment
4. Complete datacenter failure → Disaster recovery site
