### Automated Analysis Templates

#### Success Rate Analysis
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AnalysisTemplate
metadata:
  name: success-rate-analysis
spec:
  metrics:
  - name: success-rate
    interval: 30s
    count: 10
    successCondition: result[0] >= 0.999
    failureLimit: 2
    provider:
      prometheus:
        address: http://prometheus:9090
        query: |
          sum(rate(http_requests_total{status!~"5.."}[2m])) /
          sum(rate(http_requests_total[2m]))
```

#### Latency Analysis
```yaml
metrics:
- name: latency-p99
  successCondition: result[0] <= 1.0
  query: |
    histogram_quantile(0.99,
      sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[2m])) by (le)
    )
```

#### Business Metrics Analysis
```yaml
metrics:
- name: application-submission-rate
  successCondition: result[0] >= baseline * 0.95
  query: |
    rate(applications_submitted_total[5m])
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

#### Metric-Based Triggers
```yaml
rollback_conditions:
  error_rate:
    threshold: 0.05  # 5% error rate
    duration: 2m
  latency:
    p99_threshold: 2000  # 2 seconds
    duration: 3m
  availability:
    threshold: 0.995  # 99.5% availability
    duration: 1m
```

#### Health Check Triggers
- **Readiness Probe Failures:** > 50% of pods failing for 2 minutes
- **Liveness Probe Failures:** > 25% of pods failing for 1 minute
- **External Dependency Failures:** Critical services unreachable

#### Business Logic Triggers
- **Authentication Service:** Login success rate < 99%
- **Application Submission:** Success rate < 98%
- **Document Upload:** Failure rate > 2%

### Manual Rollback Procedures

#### Emergency Rollback (< 2 minutes)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency rollback script
SERVICE_NAME=$1
NAMESPACE=${2:-production}

echo "🚨 EMERGENCY ROLLBACK: $SERVICE_NAME"

# Immediate traffic cutoff via feature flags
curl -X PATCH http://feature-flag-service:8080/api/flags/${SERVICE_NAME}_routing \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $EMERGENCY_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"enabled": false, "rollout_percentage": 0}'

# Argo Rollouts abort and undo
kubectl argo rollouts abort $SERVICE_NAME -n $NAMESPACE
kubectl argo rollouts undo $SERVICE_NAME -n $NAMESPACE

# Verify rollback
kubectl get rollout $SERVICE_NAME -n $NAMESPACE
kubectl logs -f rollout/$SERVICE_NAME -n $NAMESPACE

echo "✅ Emergency rollback completed"
```

#### Staged Rollback (< 10 minutes)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Staged rollback with validation
SERVICE_NAME=$1
TARGET_REVISION=${2:-previous}

# Gradual traffic reduction
for weight in 75 50 25 0; do
  echo "Reducing traffic to $weight%"
  kubectl argo rollouts set-weight $SERVICE_NAME $weight -n production
  sleep 30
  
  # Check metrics during reduction
  if ! ./scripts/validate-metrics.sh $SERVICE_NAME; then
    echo "⚠️  Metrics validation failed during rollback"
  fi
done

# Complete rollback to stable version
kubectl argo rollouts undo $SERVICE_NAME -n production --to-revision=$TARGET_REVISION
```

### Rollback Validation

#### Automated Validation Checks
```yaml
validation_steps:
  1_health_checks:
    timeout: 60s
    endpoints:
      - /actuator/health
      - /actuator/health/liveness
      - /actuator/health/readiness
  
  2_functional_tests:
    timeout: 180s
    tests:

    timeout: 300s
    metrics:
      - response_time_p95
      - error_rate
      - throughput
```
